Task
Given the meal price (base cost of a meal), tip percent (the percentage of the meal price being added as tip), and tax percent (the percentage of the meal price being added as tax) for a meal, find and print the meal's total cost.

public class Solution {

    // Complete the solve function below.
    static void solve(double meal_cost, int tip_percent, int tax_percent) {
        double tip = meal_cost*((double)tip_percent/100);
        double tax = meal_cost*((double)tax_percent/100);

        double total_cost = meal_cost + tip + tax;
        int total = (int)Math.round(total_cost);    
        //NOTE : In case of casting a float/double value to int, you generally loose the fractional part due to integer truncation.
        System.out.println(total);

//(int) Math.round(meal)
    }

    private static final Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        double meal_cost = scanner.nextDouble();
        scanner.skip("(\r\n|[\n\r\u2028\u2029\u0085])?");

        int tip_percent = scanner.nextInt();
        scanner.skip("(\r\n|[\n\r\u2028\u2029\u0085])?");

        int tax_percent = scanner.nextInt();
        scanner.skip("(\r\n|[\n\r\u2028\u2029\u0085])?");

        solve(meal_cost, tip_percent, tax_percent);

        scanner.close();
